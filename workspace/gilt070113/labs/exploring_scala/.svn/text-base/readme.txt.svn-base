Let's warm up to Scala.

Write a guessing game with total immutability (only val, no vars allowed).

A sample of user interaction is shown below:

> scala guesser.scala 
I've selected a number, can you guess it!
Enter your guess:50
Aim higher
Enter your guess:75
Aim higher
Enter your guess:88
Aim lower
Enter your guess:80
Aim higher
Enter your guess:83
You got it in 5 attempts
